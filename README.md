# Python-networking-tools
A collection of personally created Python 3 tools for networking. Currently includes a simplified wrapper of the socket module. More changes will arise as I discover more featuresI desire.
  To do:
Convert server and client to use inheritence, as they are pretty much the same object with slightly altered methods
Add an example of using both the server and the client
